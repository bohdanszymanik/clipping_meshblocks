"# Quick few lines to clip meshblock 2013 to nz coastline" 

R version - where I started, slow - some minutes to complete on a laptop with 48GB RAM and 4 cores.
Python version - even slower with geopandas but the default plotting looks nicer.

In comparison, running the clip tool in ArcGIS Pro just took a couple of seconds. What gives???
